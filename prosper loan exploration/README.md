# Loan Data Exploration 
## by Rickson


## Dataset

> The data set used contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others.


## Summary of Findings

> In the exploration and visualization, we found that:
 - The original loan amount is positvely correlated with the stated montly salary. From this relationship it can be noted that as the          monthly income increases so does the loan amount.
 - The correlation between the loan amount and debttoincome ratio is also positively correlated, indicating that individuals with high          ratios tend to have large amount of loans borrowed.
 - The amount of loan increases with good ratings, this can be attributed with decrease default of risk with better ratings
 - The amount of loans also increases with the stability of employment, this may be due to with better employment sets in increased salaries    which tend to amount to high loans.
  
> Looking at the interaction of other variables:
 - Better ratings are associated with high monthly salaries, this may be due to the increased capability of paying back.
 - Most of the individuals with good ratings are not in groups, they may have obtained them due to constant access to and repayment of loans    from the banks.  
 - Increased ratings are associated with stable employment opportunities like employed and full-time.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> In the presenation I have majorly focused on factors that affect the loan amount and how they are related to the loan amount.These are:     stated monthly salary, debttoincome ratio, employment status, currently in group and credit rating.
> I started by showing the distribution of the loan amount and the stated monthly salary, I proceeded to show the interaction between the     quantitative varibles and qualiative variables. I have further shown how the some categorical variables(credit grade and employment         status) are related with the loan amount and the stated montly salary.
